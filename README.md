# RPG Genshin game in discord (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

## Introduction

This project is just to make my hobby and imagination during my childhood into reality. If you ever made a game in your notebook when you was child, you probobaly can relate to this.

Disclaimer: This project is just to practice my Javascript and NoSQL databases management skills

### Why NoSQL?

We just need to have one table and there is no relation table. NoSQL is suitable for this situation. Easy to do queries for updates, sorting for ranking and manipulate data for testing. MongoDB is used for this project.
